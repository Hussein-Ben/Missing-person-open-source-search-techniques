<p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If open source intelligence can be used to solve international crimes at the highest level then it can surely be used to find missing people. However, what I have learnt painfully is that in any case of a missing person you must act within 48 hours. After 48 hours, the trail will grow cold, conflicting information builds up and both digital information and human memory will degrade or be lost completely.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was only after reading week (12/11/2018) that I first heard that there was a student, her name Seowoo Chang (also known as jenny/jennifer) had gone missing. The fact that the missing poster was placed very frequently all over campus, suggested to me that this was serous. Me and my friends were curious and we searched on the google and twitter, what we discovered really concerned us. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There were three points that caused serious concern that led me to take action and actually start a search:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_793qqeh6yjby-0 start" start="1"><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">The last known sighting in deptford bridge (02/11/2018), Seowoo was wearing adidas slider sandals, the average temperature on that day was 6 degrees celsius (darksky.net), you also cannot walk far while wearing slider sandals.</span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">She did not take her phone with her, all her possessions are still in the room. I assume when they mean by possessions they also include any travel cards, bank cards etc..</span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">She is an international student, her only source of income would be from her parents (visa restrictions as well) </span></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From these three points it is obvious to anyone that she is vulnerable and the situation is life threatening. Yet, Goldsmiths university was merely relying on the metropolitan police to find her which I believe was naive and was not enough. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c6">Why Lewisham police/Metropolitan police should not be expected to carry out an extensive search ?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c4 lst-kix_336sd33g2vb9-0 start"><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">Massive cuts to the Metropolitan police budget:</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c14"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/metropolitan-police-cressida-dick-budget-cuts-violent-crime-rise-london&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1554249475595000">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/metropolitan-police-cressida-dick-budget-cuts-violent-crime-rise-london</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;The Met has lost &pound;600m in funding since 2011.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c14"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lewishamlibdems.org.uk/police_cuts&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1554249475596000">https://www.lewishamlibdems.org.uk/police_cuts</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- some of the cuts</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c4 lst-kix_xfu8h4ihtpib-0 start"><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">Increasingly violent crimes, the usual crimes such as burglary, robbery are now more violent, just look at any online local lewisham (or any london) news outlet.</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c14"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/10/tough-streets-myron-yarde&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1554249475597000">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/10/tough-streets-myron-yarde</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;article is from 2016, but it paints a well-known picture of the area.

The police would also have to search 48 hours of footage from many different cameras to find her, which is very unlikely.
